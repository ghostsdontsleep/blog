In a late chill night, Hades decided to go out for a walk in the neighborhood, a middle-class type of neighborhood where most neighbors work normal 9 to 5 jobs and seemed to possess little empathy or compassion.

Hades is 10 years old. He has medium-sized black hair and big hazel eyes. He wears a long-sleeved white shirt with blue stripes, a long red scarf around his neck, a pair of black summer shorts reaching slightly above his knees, a pair of brown slippers with some white socks. The most eye-catching element of Hades's outfit is a dark blue captain's hat with a white brim, which sits atop his head at a jaunty angle.

Born from a father who only comes at night to sleep after spending the whole day out gambling on horses, and a mother who daydreams all day about having a better husband, Hades likes his own company. He likes venturing out and discovering things by himself, such as searching for new insects, plants, and animals.

Around 10 PM, Hades left home to go to his favorite spot, the house's garden. He likes it more than his room and toys. There's nothing special about the garden, just a simple normal-sized garden with a single tree, enclosed by wooden fences. No swimming pool, no swing, no doghouse, nothing fancy...

As he stepped into the garden, he felt as if he was transported to a different world. The garden stretched out before him, inviting him to wander and explore. The sweet scent of the flowers all over him, as if welcoming him back to a place he had long forgotten. He closed his eyes and let himself get lost in the moment, feeling as though he was floating through space, weightless and free.

Suddenly, a peculiar sound caught his attention, one that he had never heard before. As he opened his eyes, he noticed an unfamiliar object standing atop a tree branch. He approached it with a mixture of curiosity, wonder, and concern, he was amazed to discover that the object was, in fact, a living creature, an __animal!__ Its round, oversized eyes and curved, pointy nose were wrapped by soft, beautiful grey feathers...It is in fact an owl.

The kid and the owl locked eyes, and in that moment, it was as if nothing else existed in the universe...
