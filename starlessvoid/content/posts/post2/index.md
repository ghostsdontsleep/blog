I guess you would much prefer if the title was "Why are some people bad ?", this is because we often see questions such as "Why are some people evil ?".

We are far more likely to question ourselves "Am i a bad person ?" rather than "Am i a good person ?". Humans give more attention to bad things, and this might be a natural defense mechanism, it's like the brain tries to anticipate bad scenarios to keep you alerted n' help you survive.

But what if we ask ourselves..."Why are certain people good ?"...What if the opposite of the popular question is the answer to it...What makes a person a good one ?... I'm gonna try to answer based on my analysis of the personnalities of many persons (friends, family, colleagues, strangers...). Again this is not a scientific or a proof based answer, this is purely based on my personal observations, and recognizing different patterns of peoples's personnalities, and you are free to disagree.

Someone is a good person because he __IS__ a good person, he didn't choose to be one, he just __IS__ a good one, it's the same way a psycopath or a pedophile is what he is, no one chose to become a pedophile...you just are one. One doesn't get to choose to be a good person, sure you could "try" to be one, you could set a high model of a good person and look up to him and try to be like him, that's what everyone who thrives to be a good person does but if you are a bad person, that's like a birth mark that needs alot of work to be removed and controlled because you are subconsciously bad.

Now the question is, okay fine... We are what we are...Why ?...How ?... What makes we "we" ? There must be a a defining factor in who we are, and why we act like we do...

The early ages of a child are the crucial times in defining or shaping a person's personnality and behaviour, a person becomes good or bad at a very early age, this due to multiple factors but they all boil down to two major ones: genetics and environment, those two are the most important ones in defining the behavior of a person, we can tell if a person is good or bad by evaluating and analyzing those two factors.

What's sad about this, is that as a kid we have no control over these two defining factors, for example a bully in school, didn't choose to become one, it's his environment that lead him into becoming one, such as an abusive father beating him or his wife...This is why, i have far more respect for people that try to do good inspite of their bad behaviors; when one recongnizes he's always doing bad actions in certain situations and tries to overcome that, that alone, is a great act of self love and respect, and for all of you doing good things, I respect you alot.


Bad people are the ones that get the spotlight sadly, and this is because bad people have a noticeably larger effect than the good ones, it only takes one bad person to have a huge effect, but it takes ten or more good persons to have a one.

In a capitalist society that rewards the bad, try to be good.
